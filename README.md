# Predictive Modeling and Classification of Temperature Data

This project delves into the predictive modeling and classification of temperature data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately predict temperature and classify temperature data into distinct categories based on historical weather data. The project employs linear regression, gradient descent, logistic regression, and ridge regression to build robust models and evaluate their performance.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Linear Regression:** The project begins by creating a linear regression model to predict the average temperature. The model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data, achieving an R² score of 0.50, indicating moderate accuracy. The analysis also explores the impact of different training/testing splits and pre-processing techniques, such as handling null values and feature selection, on the model's performance.

2. **Gradient Descent:** A gradient descent model is implemented to predict maximum temperature based on variables like sunshine, cloud cover, and precipitation. Despite the model's simplicity, it highlights the challenges of manual parameter tuning, as the R² score remains lower (0.29) compared to the linear regression model, suggesting that additional variables or more complex models might be needed for better accuracy.

3. **Logistic Regression:** The project further explores binary and multiclass classification tasks using logistic regression. In the binary classification task, the model classifies temperature as either "High" or "Low" with an accuracy of 80.12% and an AUC of 0.88, indicating strong performance. The multiclass classification, which categorizes temperature into "Low," "Moderate," and "High," achieves an accuracy of 77.54%, with the model correctly predicting the majority of cases but struggling with borderline cases.

4. **Ridge Regression**: To address potential overfitting and improve model generalization, a ridge regression model is implemented. This model introduces a bias to reduce variance and improve stability. The ridge regression model slightly outperforms the initial linear regression model, achieving a higher R² score of 0.50 and lower mean squared error (MSE), demonstrating the benefits of regularization in predictive modeling.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of various regression and classification techniques for temperature prediction. Through detailed analysis and comparison of models, the project highlights the importance of model selection, parameter tuning, and regularization in achieving accurate and reliable predictions. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of predictive modeling in the context of environmental data, offering valuable insights for further research and practical applications.
